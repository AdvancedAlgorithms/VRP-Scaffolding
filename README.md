# CVRP Scaffolding
Scaffold code for tackling the CVRP variant of the VRP - taken from last year's VRP assignment's scaffold code. We've provided tests that are meant to work for integer programming approaches to the CVRP problem - we are less sure if it works for other approaches. The tests do not work for heuristic approaches to the VRP.
